## Summary

According to the 2017 Zillow competition on Kaggle, real estate company Zillow used *millions* machine learning and statistical models and hundreds of features for each property to produce home value estimates with a median error of five percent. In this project, I fail to predict drivers of the Zestimate log error using a combination of clustering algorithms and linear modeling.

| 'logerror'                     | The target variable is log error, which is the log of the Zestimate minus the log of the actual sale price. It's a clever way to deal with right-skewed, heteroskedastic home values because it makes error terms relative to to home value. It also avoid the downfall of using percentage error, which woud have favored models with negative errors. |

## Planning pipeline

Step 1: Acquire

* If data is in a SQL database, run select * from zillow.2017 via SQL IDE.
* If data is a csv file, use pandas, e.g. pandas.read_csv().

These steps are covered in acquire.py.

Step 3: Prepare Data

* Drop columns missing over forty percent of data.
* Impute building quality and lot size with median.
* Drop any rows missing other columns.
* Convert zip codes, heating system, pool count, and tax delinquecy flag categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
* Drop outliers based on target variable (outside 1st and 99th percentile.)
* Split data into 70/15/15 training/validation/test sets.
* 
These steps are covered in prepare.py.

Step 4: Explore & Preprocess

* Visualize attributes & interactions (Python: seaborn and matplotlib).
* Plot correlation matrix of features.
* Drop multicollinear features with variable inflation factors over ten.

Analyze: statistically and more generally (Python: statsmodels, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn).

Step 5: Model

* Constant (mean of training target error) can't be beat.
* Create clusters. They don't predict logerror and can be discarded.
* Many combinations of features can match mean but never beat it. For example, use price per square foot to make a linear model that mimics the baseline model.

Models used:

* KMeans
* LinearRegression (OLS)
* TweedieRegressor (GLM)
* LassoLars (LAR with regularization)
* LinearRegression with PolynomialFeatures

## Hypotheses

* Location (county and/or zip code) is driving log error.
* Finished square feet is driving log error.
* The ratio of building size to lot size is driving log error.
* Clusters based on latitude and longitude will identify coastal properties an these are driving log error.
* Properties with many outlying features are driving log error.

None of these hypotheses were correct.

## Results

| model | RMSE | R^2
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constant (mean) | .08 | 0 |
| Generalized linear regression | .08 | 0 |

## Recommendations

Given the data available, I am confident in saying there are no significant drivers of the targer (log error), and that this is true for both the original features and new features derived from those. I am not surprised because the Zestimate is very accurate to begin with. I would investigate next why the model is making a few hundred huge errors in the training set that are doubling the median error. In the most extreme example, the model is predicting over $1 billion for a $6 million property (where the log error is over 5.)
