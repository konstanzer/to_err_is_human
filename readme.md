## Summary

According to the 2017 Zillow competition on Kaggle, real estate company Zillow used *millions* machine learning and statistical models and hundreds of features for each property to produce home value estimates with a median error of five percent. In this project, I fail to predict drivers of the Zestimate log error using a combination of clustering algorithms and linear modeling.

The target variable is log error, which is the log of the Zestimate minus the log of the actual sale price. It's a clever way to deal with right-skewed, heteroskedastic home values because it makes errors relative to to home value. It also avoid the downfall of using percentage error which favors models with negative errors.

## Planning pipeline

Step 1: Acquire

If data is in a SQL database, run select * from zillow.2017 via SQL IDE.
If data is a csv file, use pandas, e.g. pandas.read_csv().
These steps are covered in acquire.py.

Step 3: Prepare Data

There are no missing values.
Convert all features to floats or categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Split data into 70/15/15 training/validation/test sets.
These steps are covered in prepare.py.

Step 4: Explore & Preprocess

Visualize attributes & interactions (Python: seaborn and matplotlib).
Analyze: statistically and more generally (Python: statsmodels, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn).

Step 5: Model

Create clusters that don't predict logerror and then discard them. Use price per square foot to make a lienar model that mimics the basline model, which is predicting the mean log error . See the noisy predictions that

Models used:

* k-means
* LinearRegression

## Hypotheses

### H<sub>0</sub> There is no linear correlation between log error and square footage.

### H<sub>1</sub> There is a linear correlation between log error and square footage. tenure.

* Pearson correlation = 0.000
* p-value             = 0.000

## Results

| model | beep | boop | bop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | .1 | 1 | .1 |
| k-means | .1 | .1 | .1 |

* I recommend we do better.

## Project Planning
1. Create a Trello board for project management
2. Import and explore the dataset
4. Develop clusters for exploration
    - Use 3 different combinations of featurescale data with appropriate scaler
5. Scale data appropriately 
6. Create models for predicting zestimate 
7. Communicate results using a jupyter notebook
<hr style="border-top: 10px groove blue; margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px"></hr>

## Initial Hypotheses 
- Influences of log error: 
> - Hypothesis 1: County in which the property is located
> - Hypothesis 2: The appraised tax value of a property 
> - Hypothesis 3: The year when the property was built
> - Hypothesis 4: Square footage of the property
