## Planning pipeline

Step 1: Plan

*Business objective:*

*Project objective:*

Step 2: Acquire

If data is in a SQL database, run select * from zillow.2017 via SQL IDE.
If data is a csv file, use pandas, e.g. pandas.read_csv().
These steps are covered in acquire.py.

Step 3: Prepare Data

There are no missing values.
Convert all features to floats or categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Split data into 70/15/15 training/validation/test sets.
These steps are covered in prepare.py.

Step 4: Explore & Preprocess

Visualize attributes & interactions (Python: seaborn and matplotlib).
Analyze: statistically and more generally (Python: statsmodels, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn).

Step 5: Model

Train on minority oversampled data using SMOTE.

Models used:

* k-means
* DBSCAN
* Hierarchical

## Hypotheses

### H<sub>0</sub> There is no linear correlation between log error and square footage.

### H<sub>1</sub> There is a linear correlation between log error and square footage. tenure.

* Pearson correlation = 0.000
* p-value             = 0.000

## Results

| model | beep | boop | bop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | .1 | 1 | .1 |
| k-means | .1 | .1 | .1 |

* I recommend we do better.
